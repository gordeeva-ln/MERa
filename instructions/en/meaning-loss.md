## Given
- First sentence (green)
- Second sentence (blue)

## Which means "similar meaning"?
Context:
- Suppose you are reading text that contains the first sentence.
- Somebody replaced the first sentence with the second sentence.

"similar meaning":
- If the further understanding of the text does not change after the replacement, then the second sentence has the similar meaning as the first one.

##Task
1. Read both sentences.
2. Choose one of the options: 
   - "Yes" (similar meaning), 
   - "No" (different meaning).
   - "The second sentence does not make sense" (if the second sentence makes no sense).
